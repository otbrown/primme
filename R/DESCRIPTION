Description:
    R interface to PRIMME, a library devoted to the efficient computation of a
    few eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors of large real symmetric
    or Hermitian matrices. This package provides functions to compute the
    eigenpairs and singular triplets of the largest, smallest and interior
    values -- aka 'eigs()' and 'svds()' in MATLAB and Python SciPy. Optionally
    preconditioners and educated initial guesses can be used to accelerate
    convergence.
